# UDP Ping Pong with Wireshark

This project was done as part of our university course **CS330 - Computer Networks**.   
We made a small client-server app using UDP. The client sends "ping" and the server replies with "pong".

---

## Tools Used
- Java
- Wireshark

---

## What we did:
- Client sends 10 pings.
- Server replies with pong.
- We calculate RTT (Round Trip Time).
- Then we try with packet loss (0.3, 0.5, 0.8).
- We used Wireshark to see the packets.

## Screenshots:
ðŸ“¸ Wireshark + server log + ping result  
(see images folder)

## Filters we used in Wireshark:
```text
udp
udp.port == 9999
ip.addr == 192.168.100.13
```

## Files in this repo:
- PingPongClient.java
- PingPongServer.java
- filters.txt
- images folder

## Notes:
This was a group project. We all worked on different parts.  
It helped us understand how UDP and packet analysis works.
